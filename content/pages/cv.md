## Interests
A voracious reader of both fiction and non-fiction. Idealist that loves to support and help the causes he believes in, from a greener world to the spread of knowledge on the importance of privacy and FOSS. Spends time in the kitchen whenever he can and loves to connect to foreign cultures through both cooking and travel, when possible combining the two. When not walking, running or biking through nature, I will be found on the rugby pitch being distracted by the sheep and dogs that surround the field.
