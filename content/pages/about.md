Summary: A blurb about me and my research

# Matthijs van Wolferen
After my LL.M., I fell in love with academic research, writing and teaching and have made it my goal in life to succeed in these things. I am currently a Ph.D. student in my second year, a place won after a Master thesis on the effects of the Aarhus Convention on the European Court of Justice it's interpretation of article 263 TFEU that was awarded a nine. My current research is in line with the field that has held my interest since the start of my LL.M., judicial protection in the European Union.

Other areas of study and research are European Environmental Law and Gambling Regulation within the Member States vis-a-vis Regulation by the Union. However, music of all genres, culinary exploits, Islay single malts, watches and most importantly, shelves upon stacks upon piles of books are the non-legal things that keep me going. Please feel free to click on any of the links to see my life, c.v. or current research.
